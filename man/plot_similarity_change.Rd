\usage{
plot_similarity_change(similarity_results, plot_type)
}
\arguments{
\item{similarity_results}{The list object returned by `calculate_similarity()`.
For `plot_type = "yearly_turnover"`, the input should be from `group_by = "year"`.
For the other two plot types, the input should be from the more detailed
`group_by = c("year", "plot_id")`.}

\item{plot_type}{A character string specifying the plot to generate. Must be one of:
\itemize{
  \item `"yearly_turnover"`: A line plot showing the similarity of each year's
    average community to the previous year.
  \item `"within_year_heterogeneity"`: Violin plots showing the distribution of
    pairwise similarities between all plots within each year.
  \item `"plot_turnover"`: A line plot tracking the similarity of each
    individual plot to itself in the previous year.
}}
}
\value{
A ggplot object.
}
\description{
Creates one of three plot types to visualize community similarity dynamics
over time, based on the output of `calculate_similarity()`.
