\title{Plot a Plant-Centric Pollen Sharing Network}
\usage{
plot_pollen_network(
  years,
  focal_plant = NULL,
  colors = list(plant = "lightseagreen", edge = rgb(104, 99, 219, max = 255, alpha = 80),
    focal_plant = "gold", focal_edge = "red"),
  vertex_size_transform = function(pollen) 5 * sqrt(pollen),
  edge_width_transform = function(weight) 0.5 * weight
)
}
\arguments{
\item{years}{A numeric vector of years to include in the plot.}

\item{focal_plant}{A character string specifying a plant code (e.g., "Suc_pra")
to highlight in the network plot.}

\item{colors}{A named list of colors for the plot components.}

\item{vertex_size_transform}{A function that takes a vector of total pollen
counts per plant and returns a vector of vertex sizes. This allows for custom
scaling of nodes. Defaults to `function(pollen) 5 * sqrt(pollen)`.}

\item{edge_width_transform}{A function that takes a vector of edge weights
(co-occurrences) and returns a vector of edge widths. This allows for custom
scaling of edges. Defaults to `function(weight) 0.5 * weight`.}
}
\value{
A plot generated by `igraph`.
}
\description{
This function visualizes the pollen co-deposition network among plant species
in a circular layout.
}
\details{
The function first creates a stigma-by-plant matrix from the pollen data.
It then projects this into a plant-by-plant network, where the edge weight
between two plants represents the number of stigmas on which their pollen
was found together.
