\title{Calculate Pollinator Community Turnover for a Focal Plant}
\usage{
calculate_pollinator_turnover(rate_data, focal_plant, level = "locality")
}
\arguments{
\item{rate_data}{A data frame containing standardized interaction rates,
typically the output of `summarize_interaction_rate()`. It must contain
columns for `year`, `plot_id` (if calculating at plot level),
`pollinator_id`, and `rate`.}

\item{focal_plant}{A character string specifying the plant code of the
focal species for which the rates were calculated (used for labeling).}

\item{level}{A character string specifying the level of analysis:
`"locality"` (aggregates across plots within years) or `"plot"` (calculates
turnover for each plot individually).}
}
\value{
A data frame with the year-to-year similarity values.
  If `level = "locality"`, columns are `year1`, `year2`, `year_pair`, `similarity`.
  If `level = "plot"`, columns are `plot_id`, `year1`, `year2`, `year_pair`, `similarity`.
}
\description{
Calculates the year-to-year similarity (Ruzicka index) of the pollinator
community visiting a specific focal plant species.
}
\details{
This function takes summarized interaction rates (interactions per visit) and
reshapes the data into a community matrix (years or plot-years as rows,
pollinator species as columns). It then uses `vegan::vegdist` with
`method = "jaccard"` (which calculates the Ruzicka distance for quantitative
data) to find the dissimilarity between consecutive time points. The final
output is the similarity, calculated as `1 - distance`.
