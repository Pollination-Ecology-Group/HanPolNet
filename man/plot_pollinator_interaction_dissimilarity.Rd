\title{Plot Pollinator Interaction Dissimilarity Against a Null Model}
\usage{
plot_pollinator_interaction_dissimilarity(
  years,
  top_n_pollinators = 20,
  min_plots = 3,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{years}{A numeric vector of years to analyze.}

\item{top_n_pollinators}{An integer specifying how many of the most abundant
pollinators to include in the plot. If NULL, includes all pollinators found
in enough plots.}

\item{min_plots}{An integer. Pollinators observed in fewer than this many plots
within a year will be excluded, as dissimilarity cannot be calculated. Defaults to 3.}

\item{...}{Additional filtering arguments passed to `get_interaction_data()`
(e.g., `is_pollinator = TRUE`).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the calculated dissimilarities (for now). Plotting will be added later.
}
\description{
Calculates and plots the average Morisita-Horn dissimilarity of a pollinator's
interaction partners (plants) across different plots within a year, comparing
observed values to a null model expectation.
