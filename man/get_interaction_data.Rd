\title{Get, filter, and standardize plant-pollinator interaction data}
\usage{
get_interaction_data(
  years = NULL,
  plot_id = NULL,
  plant_species = NULL,
  pollinator_species = NULL,
  verified_taxa = NULL,
  is_pollinator = NULL,
  start_time = NULL,
  end_time = NULL,
  experiment_run = NULL,
  remove_zeros = TRUE,
  standardize = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{remove_zeros}{A logical value. If `TRUE` (the default), it removes rows
where no interaction was recorded (i.e., where `plant_code` is `NA`).}

\item{standardize}{A logical value. If `FALSE` (the default), the raw `interaction_count`
is returned. If `TRUE`, the `n_visits` and the standardized `rate` columns are added.}

\item{...}{(All other filtering arguments remain the same).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the interaction data. If `standardize = TRUE`,
  it includes `n_visits` and `rate` columns.
}
\description{
This function retrieves the interaction data, allowing for flexible filtering
and an option to standardize interaction counts by sampling effort.
}
\details{
Standardization is performed by calculating the total number of sampling visits
(`n_visits`) for each unique combination of `plot_id` and `experiment_run`
across the **entire dataset**. This effort value is then joined back to the
filtered data. A new column, `rate`, is calculated as `interaction_count / n_visits`,
representing the number of observed interactions for that record per sampling visit.
