\usage{
plot_hca_neighborhood(
  hca_data,
  abundance_data,
  focal_species,
  plot_type = "by_year",
  plot_id = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{hca_data}{A data frame produced by `calculate_hca()`.}

\item{abundance_data}{A standardized data frame from `get_plant_data(output = "standardized")`,
used to get the focal species' abundance.}

\item{focal_species}{A character string specifying the plant code of the
focal species. This must match the one used in `calculate_hca()`.}

\item{plot_type}{A character string specifying the plot to generate. Must be one
of `"by_year"`, `"by_plot"`, or `"grid"`.}

\item{plot_id}{A numeric value specifying the plot to display. Only required
when `plot_type = "by_plot"`.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object.
}
\description{
This function creates visualizations of the Heterospecific Co-flowering
Abundance (HCA) index alongside the abundance of a focal species.
}
\details{
This function takes the output from `calculate_hca()` and the original
standardized abundance data to create one of three plot types:
\itemize{
  \item `"by_year"`: Faceted violin plots comparing the distributions of
    conspecific and heterospecific abundance for each year, with p-values
    from a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
  \item `"by_plot"`: A timeline for a single, specified plot, showing how its
    floral neighborhood has changed over the years.
  \item `"grid"`: A comprehensive view showing a bar for every plot, faceted by year.
}
