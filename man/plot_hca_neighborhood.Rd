\arguments{
\item{hca_data}{A data frame produced by `calculate_hca()`.}

\item{abundance_data}{A standardized data frame from `get_plant_data(output = "standardized")`.}

\item{focal_species}{A character string specifying the plant code of the focal species.}

\item{years}{A numeric vector of years to include in the analysis.}

\item{add_stats}{A logical value. If `TRUE` (the default), statistical comparisons are displayed.}

\item{colors}{A named character vector of two colors for the plot.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object.
}
\description{
This function creates side-by-side violin plots to compare year-to-year changes
in the abundance of a focal plant ("Conspecific") versus the abundance of its
neighbors ("Heterospecific" - HCA).
}
\details{
If `add_stats = TRUE`, the function performs an unpaired Wilcoxon rank-sum test
to compare the distribution of one year to the next. This test is performed
independently for the "Conspecific" and "Heterospecific (HCA)" groups, and
the results are displayed as separate brackets correctly positioned over the violins.
