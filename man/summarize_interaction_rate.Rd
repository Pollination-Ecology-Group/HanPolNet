\title{Summarize and Standardize Interaction Rates for a Focal Plant}
\usage{
summarize_interaction_rate(data, focal_plant, group_by)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame of interaction data, typically from `get_interaction_data()`.
It's recommended to pre-filter this data for your desired subset
(e.g., only true pollinators).}

\item{focal_plant}{A character string specifying the plant code of the
focal species (e.g., "Suc_pra").}

\item{group_by}{A character vector of columns to group by before summarizing.
Common choices are `c("year")` for a locality-level summary, or
`c("year", "plot_id")` for a plot-level summary.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the summarized interaction rates. It includes the
  grouping columns, `total_interactions`, `n_visits`, and the standardized `rate`
  (interactions per visit).
}
\description{
This function filters for a focal plant species, aggregates interaction counts,
and standardizes them by sampling effort to calculate an interaction rate.
